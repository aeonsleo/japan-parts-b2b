# Japan Parts B2B

The application will provide a web based platform for Auto parts suppliers and shop/workshop
owners to purchase or make requisitions to purchase auto parts which could be OEM parts or
aftermarket products.
The application will make it easy for these users to sell / purchase auto-parts, to inquire about the
same instead of doing it the traditional phone call based approach.
This application will involve financial transactions but users can create orders initially without
payments.

The Japan Parts B2B application has three actors Admin, Supplier and Shop-owner / Customer. They
interact with the application through a web interface via desktop or mobile phones. They would
usually require logged in access for using most of the application.
The supplier sells products (auto parts / consumables) on the system and the shop-owner
purchases the products.
The application will consist of frontend interfaces for Supplier and shop-owner and an admin
interface for the admin.The Admin verifies registered products, checks on shop-owners’ orders and follows up offline
with suppliers, updates orders and checks payments and invoicing.
The platform also provides means of communication between shop-owners and suppliers
regarding product’s requisition and order.
